Eventually, it was decided among the team to study the effects of mild traumatic brain injury on a college population. It was hypothesized that participants whom experienced mild traumatic brain injury during their lifetime would have longer-term cognitive and mood changes as compared to those who did not experience mild traumatic brain injury. An online, self-report survey was designed. Using several well-known measures that address cognition and mood, data was collected on over 80 participants. This data supported their hypothesis, and gave way to more opportunity for research in this field.</em>

This particular project has been credited as Kyle's senior capstone project for a graduation requirement. The data reviews age group differences of returning to normal activities after a mild traumatic brain injury has occurred. A poster for this project was presented at the 2016 Cognitive Aging conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The article for publication is currently under development, but a link will be provided below if it is accepted.</em>
