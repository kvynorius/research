As a student studying biological sciences, Kyle has maintained active and motivated in his various STEM interests. These interests include chemistry, cellular biology, neuroscience, mathematics, physics, and computing. Upon graduation, Kyle is currently looking to pursue graduate or doctoral work in biomedical engineering or other quantitative biological studies. This webpage has been designed for reviewing purposes of Kyle's active and past research projects._\r\n\r\n# **Research in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury**\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n### _In November of 2014, Kyle met with neuropsychologist Daniel Seichepine, PhD. to discuss research potentials in the neurosciences. Eventually, it was decided among the team to study the effects of mild traumatic brain injury on a college population. It was hypothesized that participants whom experienced mild traumatic brain injury during their lifetime would have longer-term cognitive and mood changes as compared to those who did not experience mild traumatic brain injury. An online, self-report survey was designed. Using several well-known measures that address cognition and mood, data was collected on over 80 participants. This data supported their hypothesis, and gave way to more opportunity for research in this field._\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\n\r\n### _Their findings for this project were presented via poster presentation at the 45th annual International Neuropsychological Society conference in Boston, Massachusetts. Travel and conference expenses were awarded to them by a University of New Hampshire grant. A paper was written on their findings, and has been accepted for publication by Frontiers Journal of Neurology, section Neurotrauma. A URL to a downloadable copy of this article is available below._\r\n\r\n### _URL: http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.3389/fneur.2016.00188_\r\n\r\n## Current Project\r\n\r\n### _During data analysis for their research in mild traumatic brain injury, they were able to extract other interesting findings, which have now developed into another paper. This particular project has been credited as Kyle's senior capstone project for a graduation requirement. The data reviews age group differences of returning to normal activities after a mild traumatic brain injury has occurred. A poster for this project was presented at the 2016 Cognitive Aging conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The article for publication is currently under development, but a link will be provided below if it is accepted._\r\n\r\n# **Questions or Comments?**\r\n\r\n## Contact information for Kyle Vynorius\r\n\r\n### _email: kvynorius@yahoo.com_ \r\n",
